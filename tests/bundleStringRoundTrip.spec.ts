// A STRING FIELD MUST SURVIVE A BINARY ROUND TRIP THROUGH THE GENERATED CODE.
//
// The generated `_pb.js` modules call `reader.readStringRequireUtf8()`, a method that does NOT exist
// in google-protobuf 3.21.4 -- which this package pinned EXACTLY. Every `deserializeBinary` on a
// message carrying a string therefore threw
// `TypeError: reader.readStringRequireUtf8 is not a function`, and that is what 7.1.0, 7.1.1 and 7.1.2 shipped to npm
// as.
//
// Nothing else here could see it. The .proto sources were right, the generated code was right, the
// auth suite was green and its 100% coverage gate was satisfied -- the generated code and the RUNTIME
// DEPENDENCY simply disagreed, and only decoding a real message exercises that seam.
//
//   node --test .test-build/bundleStringRoundTrip.spec.js
