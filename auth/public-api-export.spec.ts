// Regression guard for the package entry point.
//
// `public-api.d.ts` / `public-api.js` are GENERATED - the proto compiler deletes and rewrites
// them on every `make build` - and `create_npm_package` copies them into `npm/` as the package's
// `typings` / `main`. They used to list the proto stubs only, so `auth/` shipped inside the
// package while nothing re-exported it: `import { login } from '@ondewo/nlu-client-typescript'`
// did not resolve and consumers could only deep-import the module.
//
// The line is emitted by ondewo-proto-compiler >= 5.13.0 (append-auth-exports.sh). This asserts
// the artifacts as text rather than importing them - importing would pull in every generated
// protobuf module for no added signal - so a compiler downgrade that drops the re-export fails
// here instead of silently shipping an unusable entry point.
//
// It lives under auth/ because tsconfig.test.json compiles specs from auth/ and examples/ only.
